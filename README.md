# Power-BI-with-DAX-and-Tabular-Editor-Design-and-Building-Tabular-Models.

In this exercise, I worked with a star schema model. The aim was to create Calculation Groups that were added to the model using the Tabular Editor software. This exercise requires knowledge of Power BI Desktop for report creation, Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) in tabular models, Measures, and the use of DAX Time Intelligence Functions.
